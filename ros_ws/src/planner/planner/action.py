class Action(ABC):
    """
    Action is an abstract class for implementing an action interface,
    allowing us to easily create a set of block modules generated off
    of LLM text. The goal is that each action will operate in a pre-
    defined duck-typed manner for easy portability and integration,
    and handling implementation specific details in a single location.

    Actions are designed to be initialized, then cloned and utilized
    at execution time. This is to allow for advanced functionality
    like asynchronous execution and cancellation and error tracking.

    Implementers of the action interface are expected to implement
    the following methods:

    _execute() - the actual execution - parameters are variable based
        on what's needed for the Action
    _cancel() - a method that handles special cancellation logic for
        the action. For instance, if you have a long running network
        call, this would send a signal to kill it. If there is no
        special logic, just have the function pass.
    clone() - a method that returns a copy of the action as necessary

    Actions are expected to, if there's a return, use _set_result to
    set the result of the action. Any exceptions raised by the
    _execute function is saved against the action for future reference.
