  <description>Twinlab Nitric Fuel
Finally, a product that takes you beyond  a simple pump.*  Nitric  Fuel? floods muscles  with  Nitric  Oxide, Beta-Alanine and Creatine in an innovative bi-layer tablet designed for both quick and prolonged power and pump.* Nitric Fuel goes beyond simple "pump" products by combining the volumizing effects  of Nitric Oxide (from Di-arginine Malate and Citrulline Malate) with stamina-boosting Beta-Alanine and performance-enhancing Creatine (Di-creatine Malate).* Nitric Oxide increases blood flow, which may deliver more nutrients to muscles and help get that pumped-up post workout look.* In addition to Di-arginine Malate and Di-creatine Malate, Nitric Fuel's Power Pump Complex contains Citrulline Malate, a precursor to Nitric Oxide that helps promote resistance to fatigue and better muscle recovery; Aspartic acid, which may increase stamina; and L-histidine, an amino acid that combines with Beta- Alanine to further increase muscular strength.* We also added Glyceryl Monostearate, which helps transport water into muscle cells and may further promote muscle hydration.* All of these nutrients are combined in a unique bi-layer tablet. The gray side of the tablet dissolves quickly to kick-start your workout, while the blue side dissipates more slowly to fuel sustained and intense 1-2 hour workouts.*  *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
